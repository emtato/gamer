hi



 problem:
screen change size works, but for some reosn the window width variable revrts to 1400 in the level window itself being smaller so it cuts off the image, which
is trying to display at width 1400


method of detecting which walls it is
(x,y)
check y+4p
y-4p
x+4p
x-4p
use logic to determine which type (horizontal,vertical) and from beneath/above/ left/right hit
